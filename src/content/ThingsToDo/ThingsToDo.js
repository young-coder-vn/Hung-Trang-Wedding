                        The Els Ports Natural Park is located between the
                        regions of Baix Ebre, Montsià and Terra Alta. It is
                        distinguished by its shapes, its two differing climates,
                        as well as its fauna, a highlight being the Spanish
                        ibex, to which the park acts as a reserve. Don't miss
                        the canyoning!

                        Few cities without the status of provincial capital are
                        as important as Tortosa, which boasts 2000 years of
                        history. Every corner of the beautiful old town is
                        steeped in history. The Iberians chose to settle in what
                        is now the capital of the Baix Ebre region. In fact,
                        historians believe that it may had been the enigmatic
                        and important city of Hibera. If that was indeed the
                        case, the Ebre (Iber) river and the entire peninsula
                        were named after the city. As proof of its splendid
                        past, which saw Romans, Muslims, Jews and Christians
                        pass through, Tortosa boasts the impressive Suda Castle,
                        Saint Mary’s Cathedral and some elegant Modernist
                        buildings. It isn’t known as the city of three cultures
                        (Jewish, Arab and Christian) for nothing. Tortosa
                        experienced its golden age during the Renaissance (16th
                        century).

                        Twelfth century Templar fortress, built on a hill that

                        Although its existence was already known by the people
